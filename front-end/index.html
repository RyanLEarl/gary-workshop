              <p class="title">Artist</p>
              <p class="bio">In 1996 I retired from the Sacramento Municipal Utility District with 33 years of service. While working, every summer I spent 10 days to 2 weeks hiking the Sierra Nevada mountains high country. I have been from Lake Tahoe to 30 miles south of Mt. Whitney, hiked over Whitney twice. I am a fly fisher and loved the fishing, wasn't that much into the hiking, but that was the price of the fishing and just being in the high country.</p>
              <p class="bio">When I retired I knew that hiking would not last. I love working with my hands so I thought I would build a shop. Well I built a 20 X 40 foot work shop. I already had many hand tools, power tools, and a welder. Today I have several ceramic kilns, a couple fused glass kilns, metal lathe, gas welder, mig and electric welder, table saw, band saws, drum sander, power plane, miter saws, belt sanders, shaper, drill press, sewing machines, laser engraver and about any power hand tool you can think of.</p>
              <p class="bio">I have sold some of my projects, but mostly I give them away for presents, donate them to clubs my wife and I belong to, for fund raisers</p>
